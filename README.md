# Udacity-Make-Your-App-Material-P5
### Updated the look and feel of an app to meet Material Design specifications.

* App now uses the Design Support library and its provided widget types (FloatingActionButton, AppBarLayout, SnackBar, etc).
* App theme extends from AppCompat and uses toolbars.
* It provides sufficient space between text and surrounding elements and uses fonts that are either the Android defaults,
  are complementary, and aren't otherwise distracting.
